# 2 - Instrument Box

By right-clicking the Instrument Box (by default, located on the right corner of the screen) another set of Paketti features is available:

| Item | Description | Subtopic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Initialize...` | Creates a new empty instrument which includes pre-configured macros for common modulations: PitchBend, Filter Cutoff, Amp Envelope, Drive, etc. If the 0G01 hack is enabled, a new track is created and the command placed in the first line of current pattern alongside the C-4 note. This will be further explained later in the current chapter, so bear with me. | 2.1 |
| `Launch App...` | Sends the selected samples to desired applications. Can be used to bounce stems into another DAW or to export files into a sample manager, such as Sononym. | 2.2 |
| `Smart Folders...` | | |
| `Wipe & Slice...` | Clears all slice markers in the selected instrument. It can also replace the current slices with a new set of equally distributed slices (2/4/8/16/32/64/128). In vanilla Renoise the slices have to be manually removed in the Sampler window - so this option automates this process. | |
| `Duplicate and Select New Instrument` | Self-explanatory. | |
| `Switch Plugin AutoSuspend Off` | Quickly Enables/Disables the AutoSuspend function in Renoise. From the user manual: "Auto Suspend: When enabled, Renoise will completely shut off the plugin when it is no longer producing sound. This is mainly done to reduce CPU usage". This option is also available in the Tools menu. | |
| `Create Phrase` | Self-explanatory. | |
| `PitchBend Drumkit Sample Loader` | Automatically generates a drumkit from selected samples. Includes some macros. Samples are adjusted according the your Paketti Loader Settings (see 1.1 above). This option is also available in the Tools menu. | |
| `PitchBend Multiple Sample Loader` | Automatically generates one instrument for each selected sample. Sample are also adjusted according to Loader Settings. This option is also available in the Tools menu. | |
| `Save Selected Sample .WAV/.FLAC` | Self-explanatory. | |
| `Wipe Song Retain Sample` | Self-explanatory. | |
| `Clean Render Selected Track or Group` | Works like the "Freeze and Flatten" option in some other DAWs. It renders the current (source) track into a new instrument and automatically places a C-4 on the first line of a new track. After that, the source track is automatically muted and collapsed. Useful to share your .xrns without fearing plugin dependencies, to free up CPU or maybe just to support your resampling needs. | |
| `Record to Current Track` | | |
| `Start Sampling (Record)` | | |
