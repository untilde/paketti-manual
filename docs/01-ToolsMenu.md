| Item | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Random BPM` | Picks a random BPM value for the project. | |
| `Write Current BPM&LPB to Master column` | This writes both the current BPM and the LPB to the Master Track. Useful when you change LPB / BPM across the song patterns. | |
| `Effect Column CheatSheet Dialog` | A pop-up window containg all pattern commands available in Renoise. | See [1.3.1](https://github.com/untilde/paketti-unofficial-manual/blob/main/Documentation/1%20-%20Tools%20menu.md#131---effect-column-cheatsheet-dialog). |
| `Collapse/Uncollapse All Tracks` | Collapses (minimizes) or Uncollapses (maximizes) all the Tracks, Groups, Master and Sends. | |
| `Pattern Doubler` | Doubles the current pattern size while also duplicating its contents accordingly (notes, volume, panning, delay, samplefx columns and effect columns, and automation. | |
| `Pattern Halver` | Sets the pattern to 1/2 current size. Works *differently* from the native keybind `CTRL+F8`, as it *does not adapt pattern content* to fit the new length. Simply put: pattern length is changed to half, but notes/commands remain in place. | |
| `Global Visible Column (All)` | Expands all columns in all tracks: Volume, Pan, Delay and SampleFX.| |

### 1.3.1 - Effect Column CheatSheet Dialog

Please note: the Effect Column CheatSheet also features sliders for the Volume, Pan, Delay, SampleFX and Effect Columns. Moving a slider places the correspondent value in the highlighted row or selection in pattern. It is very effective for manually programming intricate modulations: pick an effect, move the slider, move to next line, and so on. It's also the perfect companion for Renoise newcomers who still haven't learned the most important commands.

## 1.4 - Plugins/Devices

| Item | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Debug` | Different plugin related utilities for debugging. Can be ignored by the average user. | |
| `Switch Plugin AutoSuspend OFF` | Quickly Enables/Disables the AutoSuspend function in Renoise. From the [user manual](https://tutorials.renoise.com/wiki/Plugin): "Auto Suspend: When enabled, Renoise will completely shut off the plugin when it is no longer producing sound. This is mainly done to reduce CPU usage." | |
| `Expose/Hide Selected Device Parameters in Mixer` | Display plugin parameters in the mixer as sliders. It's the default behavior for some native devices, such as the Compressor and Mixer EQ. | See [1.4.1](https://github.com/untilde/paketti-unofficial-manual/blob/main/Documentation/1%20-%20Tools%20menu.md#141---exposehide-selected-device-parameters-in-mixer). |
| `Expose/Hide Selected Track ALL Device Parameters` | Same as above, but applies to all devices in the selected track. | See [1.4.1](https://github.com/untilde/paketti-unofficial-manual/blob/main/Documentation/1%20-%20Tools%20menu.md#141---exposehide-selected-device-parameters-in-mixer). |
| `Hide Track DSP Devices for All Tracks` | If External Editors for any devices on Track DSP are visible, this will hide their External Editors. | | 
| `Bypass/Enable All Devices on Track` | Self-explanatory. Useful to check pre/post processing. In other words, how the FX chain is affecting signals in a particular track. | |
| `Load AU/VST/VST3 Plugins Dialog` | A pop-up window to quickly load instrument plugins or add them as keyboard shortcuts. These plugin shortcuts can be found under the Keys tab in Renoise Preferences. | See [1.4.2](https://github.com/untilde/paketti-unofficial-manual/blob/main/Documentation/1%20-%20Tools%20menu.md#142---load-auvstvst3-plugins-dialog). | 
| `Open Visible Pages to Fit Plugin Parameter Count` | Fully expands a plugin/device window so all the parameter sliders are visible. | |

## 1.5 - MIDI Populator

The Paketti MIDI Populator is a powerful tool to automate project configuration for external MIDI controllers and/or sequencers. It allows the user to pick MIDI inputs/outputs and quickly insert plugin instruments (up to 16), including an option to randomize the VSTi selection. A new track is generated for every selected instrument - and outputs set accordingly. These tracks can be configured for automatic Send devices and number of Volume/Pan/Delay/FX columns. 

For users who do not have external hardware sequencers, a good use case for the MIDI Populator is to receive MIDI information from applications such as VCV Rack and Pure Data. However, a third party virtual MIDI server such as LoopBe1 may be necessary to connect these applications to Renoise. This way, you can build sequences in VCV Rack, for instance, and have audio output from VST plugins inside Renoise. Speaking of audio... a virtual audio cable (VAC) could also be used to simultaneously stream audio from VCV Rack (and other applications) to Renoise.

### 1.5.1 - MIDI Populator Quickstart

1. Select MIDI inputs and outputs.
2. Manually pick a plugin for each MIDI channel or use the `Randomize VST3 Plugin Selection` to randomly pick instruments.
3. Configure the remaining options, which range from number of note columns to automatic Send devices.

Paketti will then generate a new track for each plugin, with automatic MIDI In/Out configuration and Send population (if enabled), and also `#Line-In Device` placement for all tracks, in case the objective is to use audio inputs..
